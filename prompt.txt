I want to build a website for a cafe called "Cafe Kaze Kofi." I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'm not sure how to start. I shared a basic HTML template including a header with navigation, hero section, main content with menu, about, and contact sections, and footer. I want the navigation to be fixed so it doesn’t scroll away, and to have a hamburger menu for smaller screens that slides in from the right with an overlay behind it.

I also want the hamburger icon aligned on the left side of the header near the cafe name, with a smooth sliding animation for the menu. I asked for the menu content to be added, including coffee series, soda series, matcha series, non-coffee series, and add-ons with prices. Then I asked to make the whole website responsive for phones and tablets.

We worked on the CSS to make the nav sticky, fixed the hamburger icon position, improved hover states on nav links, and added highlighting for the current section as the user scrolls. I requested an elaborated "About Us" section emphasizing the cafe’s values: quality coffee, low cost, good vibes, and a community feel.

For the contact section, I wanted an enhanced UI with a contact form, address, email, phone number, and social media links, styled nicely and user-friendly.

Then I asked about saving form submissions to a message.txt file using an external JS script, and shared some backend code with Express.js and Node.js, but faced network errors. I asked for a solution without using Node.js, like using FormSubmit.co, but instead wanted the messages saved directly to message.txt.

Since saving form submissions directly to a .txt file on the server isn’t possible without a backend, and you prefer not to use Node.js or any server-side code, the best practical approach is to use a third-party service like FormSubmit.co or Google Forms. These services handle form submissions for you and can even send the data to your email or store it in a spreadsheet.

If you want to keep everything local or self-hosted without a backend, unfortunately, JavaScript alone won’t be able to write to files on the server or client permanently due to security restrictions.

If you’re open to learning a bit of backend later, I can help you set up a lightweight backend using something simpler than Node.js (like PHP, which many hosting providers support by default). That way, you could handle form submissions and save them to a file easily.

How would you like to proceed? Want me to show you how to set up a simple PHP form handler? Or maybe guide you through using a service like FormSubmit with your existing form?
